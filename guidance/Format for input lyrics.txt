Format for input lyrics:

English title on very first line- if none, leave empty line
W-welsh title follows W- with no space- if none, this line should not exist
category (1=Traditional,2=Contemporary,3=Modern)
any alternate titles such as first line
go in immediately following lines
W-Welsh alternate titles follow W- with no space

artist name, if required to distinguish a song, goes after exactly 1 blank line

after this, spaces make no difference, and until the first
stanza label, nothing else is read by the code

a line of 3 or less characters is interpreted as a stanza label (unless [] used),
and will appear as an internal hyperlink to navigate between stanzas.
verse numbers and C (for chorus) are suggested.
other potential choices may be B or Br (bridge); C1 , C2 (if choruses change);
I or Int (intro); O or Out (outro)

1
What is written here will
be taken as lines in a stanza
with "1" as the label, 
usually meaning verse 1
W
If there are welsh lyrics for a stanza,
write them after a W line

C
W
If a stanza has only welsh lyrics,
simply make the stanza label followed by the W line

2
a stanza will be made up of all 
lines until the next stanza reference,
or the end of the document,

ignoring all blank lines

if some lines are very long, consider breaking them up- this one would format very oddly. 
It's better that this is done manually to avoid the code breaking the line in an unusual place.
likewise if a stanza has a lot of lines
then consider breaking it up with a hyphen
-
on a single line in a logical place
this will allocate it into 2 stanzas
the second will be labeled with a "-"
this prevents overcrowded slides
