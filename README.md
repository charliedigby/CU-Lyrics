Designed to create a beamer presentation for CU song lyrics. The principle is to design a template text file, to which the py file is able to add subsections, each containing lyrics to a song, and contents entries. In principle, this process can be applied iteratively, so that the file can be continuously updated with new songs.
The songs are each to be a seperate text file, with simple formating requirements in order to make it quick and simple to add to the file. The paths of all song files intended to be added are then copied to an independent text file in order to run all of them in a single batch.
