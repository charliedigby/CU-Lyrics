At the name of Jesus
1

1
At the name of Jesus
Ev'ry knee shall bow,
Ev'ry tongue confess him       
King of glory now;
'Tis the Father's pleasure
We should call him Lord,
Who from the beginning
Was the mighty Word.

2
Humbled for a season
To receive a name
From the lips of sinners,
Unto whom he came.
Faithfully he bore it,
Spotless to the last,
Brought it back victorious
When from death he passed.

3
In your hearts enthrone him!
There let him subdue
All that is not holy,
All that is not true.
Crown him as your Captain,
In temptation's hour;
Let his will enfold you
In its light and pow'r.

4
Brothers, this Lord Jesus
Shall return again
With his Father's glory,
With his angel train,
For all wreaths of empire
Meet upon his brow,
And our hearts confess him
King of glory now.
