The Lord's my Shepherd
2
Psalm 23

Townend
1
The Lord's my Shepherd I'll not want
He makes me lie in pastures green
He leads me by the still still waters
His goodness restores my soul
C
And I will trust in You alone
And I will trust in You alone
For Your endless mercy follows me
Your goodness will lead me home

2
He guides my ways in righteousness
And He anoints my head with oil
And my cup it overflows with joy
I feast on His pure delights
3
And though I walk the darkest path
I will not fear the evil one
For You are with me
And Your rod and staff
Are the comfort I need to know
