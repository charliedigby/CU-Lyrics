Abide with me
1


1
Abide with me fast falls the eventide
The darkness deepens Lord with me abide
When other helpers fail and comforts flee
Help of the helpless O abide with me
2
Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day
Earth's joys grow dim its glories pass away
Change and decay in all around I see
O Thou who changest not abide with me
3
I need Thy presence ev'ry passing hour
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's pow'r
Who like Thyself my Guide and Stay can be
Through cloud and sunshine O abide with me
4
I fear no foe with Thee at hand to bless
Ills have no weight and tears no bitterness
Where is death's sting where grave thy victory
I triumph still if Thou abide with me
5
Reveal Thyself before my closing eyes
Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies
Heav'n's morning breaks
And earth's vain shadows flee
In life in death O Lord abide with me
