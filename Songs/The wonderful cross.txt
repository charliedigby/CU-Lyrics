The wonderful cross

When I survey

When I survey the wondrous cross
On which the Prince of Glory died
My richest gain I count but loss
And pour contempt on all my pride

Sorrow and love flow mingled down
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet
Or thorns compose so rich a crown

O the wonderful cross
O the wonderful cross
Bids me come and die and find
That I may truly live
-
O the wonderful cross
O the wonderful cross
All who gather here by grace
Draw near and bless Your name

That were an offering far too small
Love so amazing so divine
Demands my soul my life my all
