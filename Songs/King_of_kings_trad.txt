King of kings majesty
God of heaven living in me
Gentle Saviour closest friend
Strong deliv'rer beginning and end
All within me falls at Your throne
C
Your majesty I can but bow
I lay my all before You now
In royal robes I don't deserve
I live to serve Your majesty
2
Earth and heaven worship You
Love eternal faithful and true
Who bought the nations ransomed souls
Brought this sinner near to Your throne
All within me cries out in praise
