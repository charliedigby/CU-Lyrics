Faithful One
2

V
Faithful One so unchanging
Ageless One You're my Rock of peace
Lord of all I depend on You
I call out to You again and again
I call out to You again and again
C
You are my Rock in times of trouble
You lift me up when I fall down
All through the storm
Your love is the anchor
My hope is in You alone
