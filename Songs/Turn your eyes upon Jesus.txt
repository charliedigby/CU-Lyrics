Turn your eyes upon Jesus
2


1
Turn your eyes upon Jesus
Look full in His wonderful face
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim
In the light of His glory and grace
2
Turn your eyes to the hillside
Where justice and mercy embrace
There the Son of God gave His life for us
And our measureless debt was erased
C
Jesus to You we lift our eyes
Jesus our glory and our prize
We adore You behold You our Savior ever true
Oh Jesus we turn our eyes to You
3
Turn your eyes to the morning
And see Christ the lion awake
What a glorious dawn fear of death is gone
For we carry His life in our veins
4
Turn your eyes to the heavens
Our King will return for His own
Every knee will bow every tongue will shout
All glory to Jesus alone
