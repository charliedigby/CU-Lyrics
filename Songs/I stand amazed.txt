I stand amazed
1
How marvelous

1
I stand amazed in the presence
Of Jesus the Nazarene
And wonder how He could love me
A sinner condemned unclean
C
How marvelous how wonderful
And my song shall ever be
How marvelous how wonderful
Is my Saviour's love for me
2
For me it was in the garden
He prayed not My will but Thine
He had no tears for His own griefs
But sweat drops of blood for mine
3
In pity angels beheld Him
And came from the world of light
To comfort Him in the sorrows
He bore for my soul that night
4
He took my sins and my sorrows
He made them His very own
He bore the burden to Calvary
And suffered and died alone
5
When with the ransomed in glory
His face I at last shall see
'Twill be my joy through the ages
To sing of His love for me
